  <div><p class="text"><strong>The South Carlonia Gamecocks Football team is the football for the Universty of South Carolina. Their first season was 1892. Their first confernce was Inderpendent (1892-1921). However, now they are part of the SEC. They joined the SEC in 1990. Their first season in the SEC they were in 4th place with a 5-6 record. In 2010 the Gamecocks were invited to the Peach Bowl. However, the Gamecocks unfortunetly lost to the Florida State Seminoles 17-26. Recently the Gamecocks have improved, a 9-4 record in 2017 and 8-5 record in 2022. Desipte these efforts the 4 team playoff has prevented them from devolping a playoff berth. However, this year with the first year of the 12 team playoff the Gamecocks have a high chance of qualifying. Recently (December 4th, 2024) ranked 16 in the AP poll and big losses across the SEC improving their probablity making the playoffs. If they beat, the 12th ranked school in the country, Clemson they are likely to guarantee their spot in the playoffs.</strong></p><img id="lucas"alt="Gamecocks walking out"src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/4b7b45_3ceb13b201b848138fc8ff4552dc8bc2~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_556,h_370,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/4b7b45_3ceb13b201b848138fc8ff4552dc8bc2~mv2.jpg">

  <p class="stupid"><div><img class="cocky" alt="Cocky the Gamecock Mascot" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/Cockyspringgame.jpg"><strong><br>Cocky, the mascot, is chosen from the stutdent body. While Sir Big Spur is the Gamecocks live mascot. The reason the USC chose the Gamecocks is because of milatary tatics. While that sounds strange, a prominet militia leader from South Carolina used tatics called "The Fighting Gamecock" during the Revoultionary War. The term was important is SC making its way into the CFB team. Sir Big Spur only changes when he dies. While the person in the Cocky suit is changed every year.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGLLw7GUiEw"> They are revealed is revealed at graduation.</a></strong><img class="cocky"alt="Sir Big Spur"src="https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2022/08/sir-big-spur.jpg?w=2880"></p></div>
<h3 class="sub">Rivalries</h3>
 <div><img alt="Palmetto Rivalry"class="rival"src="https://www.abccolumbia.com/content/uploads/2024/07/x/s/palmetto-series-logo.png"><ul class="text">
   <li class="text"><strong>South Carolina vs Clemson</strong></li>
   <strong>The offical name is the <a href="https://thepalmettobowl.com/">Palmetto Bowl</a>.The location has caused this rivalry. Both universties are in South Carolina and are only an hour drive away from eachother. The first game was 1896. This rivarly hasn't been as even sided as Gamecock fans would like. Clemson has won 73 while USC has won only 43. However, this year the Palmetto Bowl has a lot of weight. Whom ever wins it will be cast into the 2024 12 team playoff. Alowing the Gamecocks their first berth and Clemson their 7th chance. All eyes in South Carolina are always on this rivalry.</strong>
   <li class="text"><strong>South Carolina vs Geogria</li>
     The reason for this rivalry is also location. However a much bigger distance being a 3hr drive. The Gamecocks and UGA didn't play this year. However, the UGA beat USC 24-14 last year during week 3. This rivalry is also much more one sided than the last. Geogria winning 55 and the Gamecocks only winning 19. The Bulldogs slam the Gamecocks fingers in the door whenever they play. However, with Shane Bemer and a strong young core. South Carolina has a chance to beat the Bulldogs the next time we play.
